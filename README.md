## Group Expense Application
    This application is to track and add members to a group expense record



## MVP 
-- User should be able to login/register/logout
-- Add bills to the Group
-- Remove bills from the group 
-- Edit the amount of money
-- Basic graphs on the finances of the group
-- Add other users to your group/house



## Icebox
-- Have multiple groups/houses
-- Have a tagging system for each type of bill
-- D3 (Only if I have extra time, idea for cool breakdown of finances)
-- Theme Switcher: Dark mode/Light mode



## Additional Technologies
-- Sass (Planning on using this for most of the styling)
-- ChartJS (Will be used for finance overview graphs)
-- NodeMailer (Going to be used to send invites to users who aren't registered yet)
